~~ofxQuadWarp has a dependency on ofxOpenCV which comes packaged with OF.~~

Updates include:

- saving / loading quadwarp state.
- mouse corner selection and dragging.
- keyboard shortcuts for nudging corners using arrow keys.
- keyboard shortcuts for selecting corners, used in tandem with mouse for quick setup.

### note
this fork(shiyuugo/ofxQuadWarp) use [ofxHomography](https://github.com/paulobarcelos/ofxHomography) instead of ofxOpenCv.
ofxHomography is included in /src, no need to add other addons.
